In using ChatGPT to recreate my code for HW3, I found it easier, since I knew what was involved with the program. I still missed having two tater tots move, and the image still did not resemble something recognizable as a hot dog and tater tots. It used a lot of code that we haven't experienced yet. and about half of the number of lines of code and spaces that I used. Chat GPT was helpful in my figuring out how to do some movement, though I don't have 100% understanding of the how it worked, which I feel is more important. I didn't use a Generative AI image as the instructions said you "can make at least one", not you must. I have been using Chat GPT because that is what we have been using, and it functioned pretty much as I expected as for the image output.
