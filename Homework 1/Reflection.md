In examination of the differences between what I created versus what Chat GPT created I noticed a couple of things. 
In the code I created, my output was an approximation of what I was trying to create.
My hot dog looked like a hotdog, and my tater tots looked like tater tots.
Chat GPT however was different. Chat GPT had the elements of what I asked for in a very broad sense, 
but to look at the image created would not give you the impression of a plate with a hotdog and tater tots.
Chat GPT had all the elements of what I requested, but did not create easily recognizable output.
I tried a couple of different ways to get it to generate a recognizable image, but I wasn't succesful.
My conclusion at this point is that while Chat GPT can be helpful, it is limited by our ability to define what we want.
