Again, I tried multiple iterations of the code for a hot dog and tater tots on a blue plate on a brown (table) surface, with the hotdog, buns, and condiments moving in response to wasd. I also wanted 2 tater tots to move randomly.
In the code I created, my output was an approximation of what I was trying to create.
My hot dog looked like a hotdog, and my tater tots looked like tater tots. The hot dog moved correctly in response to the wasd keys, 2 tater tots moved albeit not randomly, but 1 side to side, and 1 up and down.
Chat GPT however was different. Chat GPT had the elements of what I asked for in a very broad sense, 
but to look at the image created would not give you the impression of a plate with a hotdog and tater tots.
Chat GPT had all the elements of what I requested, but did not create easily recognizable output.
I tried a couple of different ways to get it to generate a recognizable image, but I wasn't succesful.
My conclusion at this point is still that while Chat GPT can be helpful, it is limited by our ability to define what we want.
